Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
designed to handle everything from small to very large projects
with speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast
performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce,
and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient
staging areas, and multiple workflows.

Print help for the sub-command load:
```sh
$ module help load

USAGE:
        module add     modulefile...
        module load    modulefile...
                Load modulefile(s) into the shell environment. Loading a
		'group-head' will extend the MODULEPATH. E.g.: loading a 
		compiler makes additional modules like openmpi and libraries
		compiled with this compiler available.
```
