== Build-blocks for modules build from binary packages

It is strongly recommended to write build-blocks for modules build from binary packages the same way as for modules build from source. Document each step in a `README.md`. If possible, try to script the installation.

For more details and to get an idea please have a look at the 
link:https://gitlab.psi.ch/Pmodules/buildblocks/tree/master/System/mxm[`mxm` module] in the `System` group as example.
