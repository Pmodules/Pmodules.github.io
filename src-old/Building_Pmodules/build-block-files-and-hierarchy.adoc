== Files and directories in a build-block

Mandatory files in a build-block are

1. the build-script,
2. the modulefile
3. and a variants file

In some cases additional files like patches are required. These additional files might be required only for certain versions or operating systems.

| `$P`

| `$P/build`
| build-script with instructions to build the module. This script will be executed by the `modbuild` interpreter.

| `$P/modulefile`
| the modulefile

| `$P/$V_MAJOR[.$V_MINOR[.$V_PATCH_LEVEL]]/`
| Directories for patches or other required files which are specific to certain versions. These directories can also be used for variant-files. 


| `$P/files/variants[.$SYSTEM]`
| file specifying the *variants* for the module and given version. A *variant* specifies the build- and run-time dependencies and the release for a particular module version. The value of `$SYSTEM` defaults to the string returned by `uname -s` or can be set on the command line with the `--system` option.
