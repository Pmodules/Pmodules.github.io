== Releases

The life-time of a module has three phases:

.*unstable*
A module is unstable during development and testing. As long as a module is unstable, it can be changed.

.*stable*
After testing a module is marked as stable. Changes to the module are not allowed any more.

.*deprecated*
A module marked as deprecated should not be used any more. Deprecated modules can be removed after a certain time in this phase.
